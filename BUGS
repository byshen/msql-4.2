How to report a bug in mSQL
===========================

Reporting a bug without information showing how to reproduce the bug
doesn't help to solve the problem as we can only solve the problems that
we can reproduce.  If you find what you think is a bug, please gather the 
following information

	o Output of "msqladmin version"
	o A dump of the database (using msqldump)
	o The query or queries that reproduce the problem
	o A description of the problem

Once you have the above information, please provide the details in
the support forum available from our web site.  We fix every bug reported 
that we can reproduce before the next release.
