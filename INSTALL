Installation instructions for mSQL 
---------------------------------- 

A quick outline of the installation process is given below.


1.	Unpack the source code.  (you already have as you are reading this)

4.	Run the setup utility (Note: use ./setup to ensure you get the
	mSQL setup utility and not a system utility).

5.	After setup has completed,  you can edit a couple of default
	configuration values in src/site.mm if you wish.  If you want to
	change the installation directory from the default location,
	edit src/site.mm and redefine the INST_DIR value.

6.	When you are happy with the configuration, type "make all"

7.	If the compilation of mSQL completes properly, type "make install"
	This will install all the mSQL related files under /opt/msql
	(or whatever directory you set as the install directory in site.mm) 
	You may need root access to perform this step.

8.	Edit /opt/msql/msql.conf to see if everything is OK.
	The only thing you might change in a normal installation is the
	username of the mSQL_User or the Admin_User.  By default, mSQL is 
	configured to run as the user 'daemon' with root being the admin
	user (i.e. the one who can create databases, shutdown the server
	etc).
