****** PLEASE NOTE ******

Lite and W3-mSQL, the scripting language and web development tool
released with Mini SQL 2.x is no longer supported.  The language has
been reimplemented and is now available as a stand-alone package from
our web site, www.Hughes.com.au

The language is now called Ember.  It is totally compatible with Lite /
W3-mSQL scripts but is a much better implementation of the language.  It
is smaller, faster (up to 7 times faster), and more reliable.  It can
also be embedded in other C applications.  In short, it is a complete
replacement for Lite / W3-mSQL that is faster and more reliable.

For more information please see the web site.
