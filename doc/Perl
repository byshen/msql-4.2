mSQL access from Perl.
---------------------

The most common perl based interface for accessing an mSQL database is
using DBI in conjunction with the mSQL DBI module.  To install the
required components simply follow the instructions below.

NOTE: mSQL 4 is API compatible with mSQL 2 & 3.  This module was designed
to work with mSQL 2.  It will work perfectly well with mSQL 4 without
any modification at all.

1. Download the DBI and Msql-Mysql-module files from your local CPAN
archive.  They are located in the modules/by-module/DBI and
modules/by-module/Msql directories.

2. Unpack the DBI tar file and compile the code in the usual way (i.e.
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

3. Unpack the mSQL module's tar file  (eg. zcat Msql*tar.gz | tar -xf -)

4. Configure the module and generate the Makefiles by running 
"perl Makefile.PL".  You will be asked a few configuration questions.
If you do not want to build mysql support (this module supports both 
mSQL and mysql) then select option 2 from the menu (mSQL only) for the
first question.  When asked for your mSQL installation directory, please
enter /usr/local/msql3 (or where you installed it).

5. Build the software using "make"

6. Ensure that the mSQL server is running and that there is a database
called test available (eg. msqladmin create test).

7. Test the module using "make test"

8. If all went well the simply run a  "make install"
